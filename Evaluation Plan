# üìò DeepACTIF Publication Plan

## ‚úÖ Goal: Publish DeepACTIF as a General, Efficient, and Robust XAI Method

To publish DeepACTIF in a top-tier venue (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR), the method must demonstrate:
- Generalizability across data types and model architectures
- Applicability to different layer types
- Strong empirical comparisons with existing XAI methods
- Practical value (efficiency, stability, faithfulness)

## üìå 3-Phase Development & Evaluation Plan

### **PHASE 1: Generalize the Method Internally**

#### üß± Target Layer Types
| Layer Type           | Model Type            | Usage                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| `LSTM`               | Recurrent models      | ‚úÖ Already supported   |
| `MLP / Dense`        | Tabular models        | ‚ûï Add support         |
| `Transformer Block`  | Sequential, attention | üî• Strongly recommended |
| `Conv2D`             | Vision (optional)     | ‚ûï For sanity check    |

#### ‚úÖ Actions
- Abstract DeepACTIF to work on arbitrary layer outputs
- Implement forward hook system to extract activations
- Apply INV aggregation on: time, tokens, neurons, or spatial grids (as applicable)

---

### **PHASE 2: Define Compatibility and Usage Guidelines**

Create a clear table explaining how DeepACTIF applies to each layer type:

#### üßæ Example: Supported Layers Table

| Layer Type         | Compatible | Aggregation Strategy   | Notes                   |
|--------------------|------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| LSTM               | ‚úÖ         | Across time             | Already implemented     |
| Transformer        | ‚úÖ         | Across tokens           | Use final encoder block |
| MLP / Dense        | ‚úÖ         | Across features         | Input or penultimate    |
| Conv2D (optional)  | ‚ùì         | Pool over spatial grid  | Optional for vision     |

---

### **PHASE 3: Evaluate Against Standard XAI Methods**

#### üéØ Key Comparison Axes
- Runtime and scalability
- Attribution stability / consistency
- Accuracy @ top-k features (feature pruning)
- Qualitative interpretability

#### üß™ Benchmark Setup

| Task                 | Dataset       | Model           | Comparison Methods             |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Sequence Classification | Gaze, ECG     | LSTM / Transformer | IG, SHAP, DeepLIFT             |
| Tabular Classification | Adult Income  | MLP / TabTransformer | SHAP, LIME, IG                |
| (Optional) Image Classification | MNIST / CIFAR | CNN              | GradCAM, IG (visual sanity)    |
